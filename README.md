# India-Threat-Analysis-Report
Developed an end-to-end dashboard project (India Threat Analysis Report) visualizing verified terrorism data across India from the South Asia Terrorism Portal (SATP) using Python and Power BI, uncovering geo-political patterns and aiding security-driven insights.
This project presents a detailed analytical study of terrorism incidents in India using a dataset verified by the South Asia Terrorism Portal (SATP). The goal is to extract meaningful patterns and support strategic decision-making through visual storytelling.

🔍 Project Overview:
Analyzed a comprehensive terrorism dataset with incident-level details such as location, year, target type, weapon used, and casualty numbers.

Applied data cleaning techniques, EDA, and statistical analysis to uncover regional trends, frequency patterns, and attack severities.

Created a fully interactive Power BI dashboard to visually represent the findings and allow real-time filtering across dimensions (e.g., state, year, target type).

🛠️ Technology Stack:
Power BI – for dashboard design and interactive visualization

Python (Jupyter Notebook) – for data preprocessing and exploration
